# Detector engine

`patterns.js` is the executable expression of this skill's pattern rules — a
zero-dependency, build-step-free detection engine that scores text for
AI-writing tells. It runs identically in Node (`>=18`) and in the browser.

The skill's [`references/patterns.md`](../references/patterns.md) is the
human-readable catalog of rules; this engine is the deterministic, testable
implementation of the regex-detectable subset, plus
stylometric and AI-tool-fingerprint detectors that don't make sense as prose.
See [`CATEGORIES.md`](./CATEGORIES.md) for the rule ↔ category mapping that keeps
the two in sync.

## Run it

```js
const AIDetector = require("./detector/patterns.js");
const result = AIDetector.analyzeText("Your text here…");
console.log(result.score, result.label, result.issues.length);
```

In the browser, load `patterns.js` as a plain script — it self-registers as a global
`AIDetector` (the `module.exports` block is guarded and only runs under
CommonJS).

## `analyzeText(text, options?)` → result

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `score` | `0–100` | 0 = clean, 100 = heavy AI |
| `label` | string | scored: `Clean` (0) / `Minimal AI signals` (1–15) / `Some AI patterns` (16–35) / `Moderate AI signals` (36–60) / `Strong AI signals` (61–80) / `Heavy AI patterns` (81–100). Unscored: `Empty` / `Too short` / `Unsupported script` / `Text too long` |
| `issues[]` | `{type, text, severity, …}` | one entry per detected pattern; `type` keys map to [`CATEGORIES.md`](./CATEGORIES.md); `severity` values are listed under [Severity and P-tiers](#severity-and-p-tiers) |
| `stats` | object | `wordCount`, per-tier counts, `contextMode`, `sourceMode`, masked-span counts, `denseAIVocab`, normalization flags, etc. |
| `document_classification` | string | `HUMAN_ONLY` / `MIXED` / `AI_ONLY` (shape mirrors GPTZero for swap-in), or `UNSCORED` on the early-exit paths |
| `class_probabilities` | `{human, mixed, ai}` | sums to exactly 1.0 |
| `confidence_category` | `low` / `medium` / `high` | |
| `highlight_sentence_for_ai` | region[] | sentence spans with source offsets + per-region score, for UI highlighting |

The four unscored labels share one result shape: `score` 0,
`document_classification` `UNSCORED`, an even `class_probabilities` split, and
`confidence_category` `low`. Branch on that classification rather than on the
score, since clean text also scores 0 and is labeled `Clean`. `Unsupported
script` marks a document dominated by an unsegmented script (Chinese/Japanese:
Han and kana characters, whose language has no inter-word spaces for
`countWords` to split on) that was declined, not scored. An incidental place
name or single Han character in otherwise English text does not qualify;
Korean (Hangul) is space-separated and scores normally.

`options.contextMode` accepts `general` (default), `technical`, `marketing`, and
`personal`. Technical mode suppresses flags that are legitimate in code-adjacent
prose (e.g. Title Case headers and eight technical-legitimate terms: `robust`,
`comprehensive`, `seamless`, `ecosystem`, `leverage`, `facilitate`, `underpin`,
`streamline`); `marketing` and `personal` are accepted and reported in
`stats.contextMode`, but currently score the same as `general`.
Invalid modes fall back to `general` and set `stats.contextModeFallback` to the
value you passed.

The skill's context profiles map to `contextMode` as follows:

| Skill profile | Detector mode | What differs |
|---|---|---|
| `linkedin` | `marketing` | The skill applies the LinkedIn tolerance profile; detector `marketing` currently scores like `general`. |
| `blog` | `general` | The skill applies the default blog tolerance profile; detector uses baseline behavior. |
| `technical-blog` | `technical` | The skill applies technical-blog tolerances; detector enables technical-context suppressions. |
| `investor-email` | `marketing` | The skill applies stricter investor-email tolerances; detector `marketing` currently scores like `general`. |
| `docs` | `technical` | The skill applies docs tolerances; detector enables technical-context suppressions. |
| `casual` | `personal` | The skill applies casual tolerances; detector `personal` currently scores like `general`. |

See upstream [`references/patterns.md`](https://github.com/conorbronsdon/avoid-ai-writing/blob/main/skills/avoid-ai-writing/references/patterns.md#detector-mode-mapping)
(context profiles are not vendored here) for the full context-profile definitions and tolerance matrix.

`options.sourceMode` accepts `plain` (default) or `rendered-markdown`. Rendered
Markdown mode masks initial YAML frontmatter and HTML comments before pattern
matching and document metrics run. Frontmatter may use LF, CRLF, or CR line
endings and must begin with a YAML mapping entry after any leading blank or
comment lines; this keeps ordinary prose between thematic breaks visible.
Comment markers inside fenced or inline code remain visible code, while an
actual unclosed comment is masked through end of file.

Masking preserves the input length and line endings so issue and
sentence-highlight offsets still address the original source. The result
reports `sourceMode`, `sourceModeFallback`, `maskedFrontmatter`, and
`maskedHtmlComments` in `stats`. When an explicit invalid source mode falls
back to `plain`, `sourceModeFallback` retains the requested value, including
falsy values; without a fallback it is `undefined`.

Comment contents are fully excluded in rendered mode. Use plain mode or a
source-hygiene linter when TODO placeholders inside comments should still be
reported.

In both source modes, `<!-- avoid-ai-writing:ignore-start -->` and
`<!-- avoid-ai-writing:ignore-end -->` exclude everything between them, markers
included, before any other pass runs. Matching is case-insensitive. A marker
counts only as a whole line: the full comment, at most three spaces of indent,
and nothing else on the line. Markers inside fenced code, indented code, inline
code, running prose, or quotations therefore do nothing, as do markers inside an HTML `<pre>`, `<code>`,
`<script>`, or `<style>` element, inside another HTML comment, or in initial
YAML frontmatter, in either source mode. Markers are found in one
left-to-right scan: whichever of these constructs opens first owns the text
until its own close, so a fence inside a comment and a comment inside a fence
are both inert. An unclosed construct runs to the end of the text. Starts nest:
the region runs from the outermost start to its matching end. An unclosed start
runs to the end of the text, and an end with no open start is ignored. Masking
preserves offsets, and `stats.ignoredRegions` counts the regions.

In both source modes, quoted material does not count against the writer. Every
Markdown blockquote line (`> `, `>> `, or the compact `>text`) is excluded,
whether it stands alone or in a block, and `stats.quotedLines` counts them. A
line such as `>=5` or `>5` is a comparison, not a quote. The content of each
double-quoted span (straight `"…"` or curly `“…”`, one line, up to 300 characters) is
blanked, and `stats.maskedQuotes` counts the spans. A nested quotation
escaped as a pair (`\"…\"`) stays inside the span, within the same
300-character limit. A straight quote right
after a letter or digit, such as the inch mark in `15"`, cannot open a span,
and a span never crosses a backtick, so a quotation holding inline code is
still scored. Single quotes are left alone because
apostrophes in contractions and possessives would pair up across ordinary
prose. Zero-width characters, lookalike letters, and roleplay markers inside a
quotation or blockquote do not raise the normalization flag.

### Severity and P-tiers

Each `issues[]` entry carries one of four `severity` values. `SEVERITY_LABELS`
in `patterns.js` maps them to P-labels:

| `severity` | P-label | Types that emit it |
|---|---|---|
| `critical` | P0 | `chatbot`, `sycophantic`, `reasoning-artifact`, `vague-attribution`, `cutoff-disclaimer`, `ai-placeholder`, `ai-citation-markup`, `ai-utm-source`, `normalization-flag` (zero-width or homoglyph characters) |
| `high` | P1 | `tier1`, `significance-inflation`, `template-phrase`, `hedge-stack`, `future-narrative`, `social-cta-closer`, `negation-chain`, `negative-parallelism`, `formulaic-opener`, `speculative-opener`, `launch-intro`, `fake-casual-prop`, `tier3-phrase-cluster`, `bullet-np-list`, `smart-punct-signature`, `normalization-flag` (roleplay markers), `fnword-trigram-entropy` (one trigram repeated across the document) |
| `medium` | P2 | `tier1-clarity`, `tier2`, `transition`, `filler`, `generic-conclusion`, `lets-construction`, `hollow-intensifier`, `lingering-attention`, `novelty-inflation`, `false-concession`, `rhetorical-question`, `real-actual-inflation`, `performed-insight`, `dev-blog-boilerplate`, `crowd-contrast`, `parenthetical-hedge`, `title-case-header`, `unnecessary-hyphenation`, `tier3-phrase`, `hashtag-stuff`, `em-dash`, `formatting`, `punct-distribution`, `cross-para-burstiness`, `uniformity` (sentence length), `fnword-trigram-entropy` (low entropy) |
| `low` | P3 | `tier3`, `emotional-flatline`, `confidence-calibration`, `low-ttr`, `uniformity` (paragraph length) |

The skill's writing rules define only P0 to P2, so `low` / P3 has no
counterpart there. The engine assigns its labels independently: a type can
carry a different tier from the skill's matching rule. For example,
`real-actual-inflation` is P2 here while the skill lists "Real/actual"
adjective inflation under P1. To block on P0 and P1, gate on `critical` and
`high`.

## `validate(original, rewritten, options?)` → result

`validate.js` checks that a rewrite kept its hands off the things the skill says
not to touch. Edit mode writes to files, so a violation there is silent
and destructive.

```js
const { validate, formatResult } = require("./detector/validate.js");
const result = validate(originalText, rewrittenText);
if (!result.ok) console.error(formatResult(result));
```

```bash
node detector/validate.js before.md after.md   # exits 1 on a preservation error
```

**Mechanical preservation errors:** fenced code modified or dropped, YAML
frontmatter changed, blockquote reworded, table cell changed, inline code
removed, URL or file path lost, or heading count/nesting changed.

The default `residualPolicy: "error"` also blocks `residual-grew`, preserving
existing API and CLI gates. This is a quality-policy failure, not evidence of
content damage. Editorial callers can opt into advisory residuals:

```js
const result = validate(originalText, rewrittenText, { residualPolicy: "warn" });
```

```bash
node detector/validate.js --residual-policy warn before.md after.md
```

The option precedes the two paths. Use `--` before paths that could be read as
options. Exit codes are 0 for no blocking findings, 1 for a failed gate or an
uncaught I/O error (such as a missing input file), and 2 for invalid arguments.
Check stderr for execution failures; exit 1 alone does not prove content damage.
Invalid API policy values throw `TypeError`.

The human-readable validator banner and residual message now distinguish mechanical
preservation from quality diagnostics under both policies. Parse the documented
API fields and issue codes for automation; normal gate exits remain 0/1. Use
`--residual-policy` only with a validator version that supports it; update the
validator and skill together. An execution or argument error is an incomplete
check, not evidence of damaged content.

| Result field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `ok`, `errors`, `warnings` | Existing aggregate gate; under `warn`, only residual growth moves from errors to warnings. |
| `stats.residual` | Existing counts and scores, or `null` if analysis was skipped/unavailable. |
| `preservation` | Additive `{ok, errors, warnings}` for mechanical checks only; excludes residual growth. |
| `quality` | Additive `{status, policy, findings, residual}` for pattern diagnostics; `residual` mirrors `stats.residual`. |

`quality.status` is `checked`, `skipped` (`skipResidual: true`), `unavailable`
(no detector), or `unscored` (either input was declined by the detector).
An unscored comparison retains the raw counts for compatibility; they do not
establish improvement. Browser callers can inject `options.detector`; Node
loads `./patterns.js` by default. `skipResidual` never bypasses mechanical checks.

**Mechanical warnings:** heading wording changed, numeric literals added or
missing, or more than 40% of the words dropped. Number comparisons are literal:
`2` to `two` may warn without being wrong. Added or removed prose claims can
escape every mechanical check. Separately review meaning, facts, units,
negation, causality, and uncertainty. A mechanical pass is not semantic proof.

Two edits this skill documents as correct are carved out so the validator never
fires on its own instructions: stripping AI tracking parameters from URLs
(`utm_source=chatgpt.com`), and rewording a heading to fix Title Case or remove
an emoji. Indented code blocks are counted but not enforced, since four-space
indentation is also how markdown continues a list item.

## Scoring the upstream docs

These commands require the full upstream clone and are not available in this
vendored bundle:

```bash
npm run self-scan          # table
npm run self-scan:check    # exits 1 if a document is over budget (runs in CI)
```

## Design notes

- **FN-biased.** False positives damage trust more than false negatives, so
  `MIXED` is wide and `AI_ONLY` requires multiple corroborating signals.
- **Scoring is non-linear.** Repeated hits of the same phrase are deduplicated;
  category weights live in the `ISSUE_WEIGHTS` table.
- **Length gates.** Under ~10 words → `Too short` (unscorable); over 10k words →
  `Text too long`.

# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
NO HYPOTHESES WITHOUT A RED-CAPABLE LOOP FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes. If you catch
yourself reading code to build a theory before the loop below exists, stop —
jumping straight to a hypothesis is the exact failure this skill prevents.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Build a Feedback Loop**

   <!-- local addition: adapted from mattpocock/skills `diagnosing-bugs` (MIT).
        Upstream Phase 1 says "reproduce consistently"; it does not say to build
        the loop first, or how. -->

   **This is the phase.** Everything else is mechanical. With a *tight* pass/fail
   signal that goes red on *this* bug, bisection and instrumentation just consume
   it. Without one, no amount of staring at code will save you. Be aggressive,
   be creative, refuse to give up — this is where disproportionate effort pays.

   Ways to construct one, in roughly this order:

   1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug
   2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server
   3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffed against a known-good snapshot
   4. **Headless browser script** driving the UI, asserting on DOM/console/network
   5. **Replay a captured trace** — a saved payload or event log, run through the
      code path in isolation
   6. **Throwaway harness** — minimal subset of the system, one function call
   7. **Property / fuzz loop** for "sometimes wrong output"
   8. **Bisection harness** — automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" so
      `git bisect run` can drive it
   9. **Differential loop** — same input through two versions or configs, diff

   **Tighten it.** Once you have *a* loop, treat it as a product: faster (cache
   setup, narrow scope), sharper (assert the specific symptom, not "didn't
   crash"), more deterministic (pin time, seed RNG, isolate the filesystem). A
   30-second flaky loop is barely better than none; a 2-second deterministic
   one is a superpower.

   **Non-deterministic bugs:** the goal is not a clean repro but a higher
   reproduction rate. Loop the trigger 100×, parallelise, inject sleeps to
   narrow timing windows. A 50%-flake bug is debuggable; 1% is not.

   **Done when** you can name **one command** you have already run at least
   once (show the invocation and its output) that is:

   - **Red-capable** — drives the real code path and asserts the *user's exact
     symptom*, so it goes red on this bug and green once fixed
   - **Deterministic** — same verdict every run
   - **Fast** — seconds, not minutes
   - **Agent-runnable** — you can run it unattended

   **If you genuinely cannot build one, stop and say so.** List what you tried
   and ask the user for environment access, a captured artifact, or permission
   to add temporary instrumentation. Do not proceed to hypothesise without a
   loop.

   Once it is red, **minimise**: shrink to the smallest scenario that still goes
   red, cutting inputs, callers, config and steps one at a time and re-running
   after each cut. Done when removing any remaining element makes it go green.
   A minimal repro shrinks the hypothesis space in Phase 3 and becomes the
   regression test in Phase 4.

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form 3–5 Ranked Hypotheses**

   <!-- local addition: adapted from mattpocock/skills `diagnosing-bugs` (MIT).
        Upstream says "form single hypothesis", which instructs the anchoring
        failure it should prevent. -->

   Generate them all *before* testing any. Single-hypothesis generation anchors
   on the first plausible idea.

   Each must be **falsifiable** — state the prediction it makes:

   > "If X is the cause, then changing Y will make the bug disappear."

   If you can't state the prediction, the hypothesis is a vibe. Discard or
   sharpen it.

   **Show the ranked list to the user before testing.** They often re-rank it
   instantly ("we just deployed a change to #3") or know what's already ruled
   out. Cheap checkpoint, big saving. Don't block on it if they're away.

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - One-off test script if no framework
   - MUST have before fixing
   - The `ponytail` skill's "lazy code without its check is unfinished" rule applies: the smallest thing that fails when the bug is present

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?
   - Use the `verification-before-completion` skill before claiming success

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   **STOP and question fundamentals:**
   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
   - Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

   **Stop and discuss with the user before attempting more fixes**

   This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)

## Signals From The User That You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultra-think this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, build + tighten + minimise the loop, check changes, gather evidence | One red-capable command, already run |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Rank 3–5 falsifiable theories, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

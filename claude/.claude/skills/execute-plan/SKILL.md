# Execute Plan - Execution Phase

## Purpose

Follow a plan generated by `/write-plan` sequentially, executing tasks efficiently while staying token-efficient through batching and subagents.

## Prerequisites

- A plan file exists in `docs/plans/`
- The plan follows the standard format from `/write-plan`

## Process

### 1. Load the Plan
- Read the most recent plan from `docs/plans/` or ask user which plan to execute
- Parse tasks and their current completion status
- Identify where to resume if partially complete

### 2. Execute Tasks Sequentially

For each task:

1. **Announce** - State which task is being executed
2. **Implement** - Make the code changes as specified
3. **Verify** - Run the verification command
4. **Fix** - If verification fails, fix before proceeding
5. **Commit** - Create the commit with the specified message
6. **Update Plan** - Mark task complete in the plan file

### 3. Batching Strategy

Group related tasks when efficient:
- Multiple small edits to the same file
- Sequential test additions
- Related refactoring steps

But always:
- Verify after each logical batch
- Commit at natural boundaries
- Never skip verification steps

### 4. Subagent Delegation

Use Task tool with subagents for heavy operations:
- Running full test suites
- Complex refactoring tasks
- Multi-file search and replace
- Build and verification steps

This keeps the main context lean and token-efficient.

### 5. Progress Tracking

After each task or batch:
- Update the checkbox in the plan file
- Add notes if any deviations occurred
- Report progress to user

### 6. Error Handling

If a task fails:
- Stop execution
- Report the failure clearly
- Suggest remediation
- Wait for user guidance before continuing

## Resume Support

When resuming a partially complete plan:
- Read the plan file
- Find first unchecked task
- Summarize completed work
- Continue from where left off

## Completion

When all tasks are done:
- Mark plan as complete
- Run final verification (full test suite)
- Summarize what was accomplished
- Suggest next steps (PR, review, etc.)
